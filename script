//Synergism corruptions saver
//Paste this code to browser console ( F12 or Ctrl+Shift+K to open on Firefox, don't remember Chrome)
//On Kongregate, you need to right click game and choose "show this frame only" / "open frame in new tab" because browser blocks cross-domain scripting.
//When using frame view, remember to export game save when exiting to be safe
//On Github version it works without anything special.
//type saveCorruptions(); to browser console to save current corruptions
//type loadCorruptions(); to load saved corruptions
//script only has one save slot. Saves persist on same browser until localStorage is cleared. (Clearing temp files/cookies)
